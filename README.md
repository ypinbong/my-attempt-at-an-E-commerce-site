# my-attempt-at-an-E-commerce-site-(full-stack)
As a web developer with no experience

This is my first attempt at a dynamic e-commerce website, it was a coding test given to me from a job application.
This is what I have accomplished in a day or two of coding, on and off, from scratch, with real life responsibilities...
It's rough around the edges to say the least, and it's not finished, but it's something.

Required to run this website is xampp,

This repo is composed of 2 main folders "Lou Geh" and "nalougeh"

Lou Geh - contains all the php files, resources (e.g. images), and analyzation of the problem written in text. You might want to put this into your root directory.
You can do this by navigating your xampp folder and finding the htdocs folder.

nalougeh - contains the sql database.

My experience in developing this website:

Being a full-stack developer is hard.
Having less than 2 days of deadline is rough.
But what this experience reminded me, is that coding is fun.
When you spend most of your time just researching, coding, and debugging that you lose track of everything-
except deadline of course. In the end, it reignited my focus into coding instead of just watching tutorials.
There is so much more to learn into implementing than just watching and listening.

In conclusion, I somehow regret of the 2 day deadline, and I felt like I could've done more to this website, but I had to take
a chance that maybe by submitting it on time I will have atleast show case what I can do and what I have gained. If somehow they could look past
my inexperience and look forward to my potential...
