# my-attempt-at-an-E-commerce-site-(full-stack)
As a web developer with no experience

***INTRODUCTION***

This is my first attempt at a dynamic e-commerce website, it was a coding test given to me from a job application.
This is what I have accomplished in a day or two of coding, on and off, from scratch, with real life responsibilities...
It's rough around the edges to say the least, and it's not finished, but it's something.

***SETUP***

1. Required to run this website is application xampp,

2. This repo is composed of 2 main folders "Lou Geh" and "nalougeh"

3. Lou Geh - contains all the php files, resources (e.g. images), and analyzation of the problem written in text. You might want to put this into your root directory.
You can do this by navigating to your xampp folder and finding the htdocs folder and move the "Lou Geh" folder in the said directory.

4. nalougeh - contains the sql database. Navigate to User/xampp/mysql/data and move "nalougeh" folder in this directory.

5. Go to your internet browser and type in the search bar, "localhost" and if you've done the previous steps you'd be able to find "Lou Geh" folder.
Open the folder and it should automatically bring you to the index.php of the website, if not, scroll through the list of files and click on the "index.php" file to
check-out the website.

***CONCLUSION***

My experience in developing this website:

Being a full-stack developer is hard.
Having less than 2 days of deadline is rough.
But what this experience reminded me, is that coding is fun.
When you spend most of your time just researching, coding, and debugging that you lose track of everything-
except deadline of course. In the end, it reignited my focus into coding instead of just watching tutorials.
There is so much more to learn into implementing than just watching and listening.

In conclusion, I somehow regret I got nothing left of the 2 day deadline, and I felt like I could've done more to this website, but I had to take
a chance that maybe by submitting it on time I was able to atleast show case what I can do and what I have gained. If somehow they could look past
my inexperience and look forward to my potential...
